- What did they try to achieve?
	- They used an Arduino with various sensors to measure the drinkability of water
	  measurement ph, total dissolved solids, temperature, turbidity,dissolved oxygen
- How can it be improved?
	- smaller box, bigger usecase then box with sensors hanging out, wireless data transmission, how true is their drinkability to actual drinkabiliy, phone app
